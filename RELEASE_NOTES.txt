1.4.2
=====
New features:
 - Support for negating *any* match string anywhere (configs and check
   parameters)
 - check_net_ping():  New check for monitoring of network connectivity
 - check_ps_*():  Process owner parameters now accept match strings,
   allowing them to take full advantage of wildcards, regular
   expressions, ranges, and/or external dynamic matching (e.g., UNIX
   group membership-based matching)
 - check_ps_service():  Additional options to tell NHC to execute
   stop/start/restart/cycle and/or user-defined actions synchronously
   (instead of backgrounding them) so that NHC can verify they worked
   correctly (or fail if not).
    - -v (Verify Sync) will only fail check if action fails
    - -V (Verify Check) additionally will make sure action appears to
      have worked (e.g., killed process is gone, started daemon is
      running, etc.)
 - check_cmd_dmesg():  New check to validate/verify or catch/flag
   certain important content in the output of the `dmesg` command.
   This check is also a working example to facilitate user wrapping of
   check_cmd_output() to generate custom/specific check failure
   messages.
 - New command-line flag:  "-e <check>" will override config file,
   execute just the specified <check>, and return success/failure
   based on that single check.  Useful for testing/troubleshooting new
   checks.  Essentially analogous to having a 1-line config file
   consisting of "* || <check>" and nothing else.
 - check_fs_mount():  Create missing mount points as necessary

Fixes/improvements:
 - Silence warnings about watchdog timer and RM detection that were
   confusing to users and/or no longer useful
 - Refactored match string range checking to be comparative rather
   than iterative.  Large ranges will see a huge speed-up!
 - Refactored generation and handling of numerical quantities to avoid
   excessive rounding/truncation errors.  For example, truncation of
   1.5TB of RAM to 1TB is a significant error!  Now uses 1536GB
   instead.
 - Fixed issue with leading zeros in node range expressions causing
   numbers to be interpreted as octal.
 - Fixed typo in getent fallback handling that kept it from working in
   certain cases.
 - Simplified the killing of the watchdog timer to avoid apparent BASH
   bug causing aborts.
 - Fixed list of SLURM node states supported by node-mark-{on,off}line
 - Fix trimming of whitespace in config files to include tabs
